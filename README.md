# Hotel-Search-App
A project I started making for the Siemens internship project but which I started working on developing from thymeleaf to Angular
- basic authentication
- used Angular's **Geolocation API** for getting the lat. and long.
- parsing json to populate database
- stylized using SCSS and materials
## Angular

Thymeleaf(old backend)(used javascript for getting the location):
- why did I use thymeleaf? ease of use as not to have problems with the cors configuration
- "stylized" using css&javascript
