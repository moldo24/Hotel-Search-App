This is the HOTEL Project for the Siemens Internship


You can log in as admin using

The Log in and Spring Security we're made mostly for having more than one user to test different ways to make reservations
I used Thymeleaf and not Angular or anything else for the frontend because of the email size, Angular would've taken 100MB in a .zip

I also put mostly every call in the HotelController mostly out of rush, and I would love to add a bit more to this project but I don't have that much time
The way I made most of this stuff is using things learned from my university projects i hope they are ok.
